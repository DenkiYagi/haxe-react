# Example project: Server side rendering (no hydration)

TODO: add some documentation here, or in `docs` and link here.

Run `make setup` to install dependencies.

Run `make server` to build and then `make start-server` to start the server on
port `8042`.

To generate static html pages instead, run `make static`, and then
`make serve-static` to start a http server serving html files on port `8043`.
